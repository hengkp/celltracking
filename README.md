# celltracking
Cell Tracking is a semi-automatic application that be able to track the live cell imaging and turns it into the measured features of interest. With easy steps starting with tracking the segmented nucleus with continuing timepoints, then segmenting some other regions of interest (extended cytoplasm) and measuring its dynamical change of intensity. To add some new daughter cells during mitosis event is also possible with the “generate sister” mode. The export VDO file of single segmented nucleus or cell can also be created after the tracking process.
